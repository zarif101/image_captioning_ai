# Capper ðŸ˜Ž - automated image captioning using Tensorflow Keras!

- The notebook 'notebook' is what I used to train the model (called 'new_deal_v5.h5')
- The 'tokenizer_v1.pickle' is the Keras tokenizer used, and it is needed because it contains the index-word mapping
- Very much a work in progress, and everything is currently disorganized
- I will clean things up and update this as I have time
- Please check out the Medium article about the project: https://zarif-azher.medium.com/ai-image-captioning-using-tensorflow-keras-1ed20a1a2b37
- The platform is built with a great framework aimed at making deployment and demos easier for data scientists, called Streamlit: https://www.streamlit.io/
- Feel free to email me at: zarif.azher@gmail.com with any questions
