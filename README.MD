# Capper - automated image captioning using Tensorflow Keras!

- The notebook 'notebook' is what I used to train the model (called 'new_deal_v5.h5')
- The 'tokenizer_v1.pickle' is the Keras tokenizer used, and it is needed because it contains the index-word mapping
- Very much a work in progress, and everything is currently disorganized
- I will clean things up and update this as I have time
- I will write a Medium article explaining the project in more detail, and the link will be here once its done
- Feel free to email me at: zarif.azher@gmail.com with any questions
